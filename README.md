Drop-libGDXSample
=================

This is a `libGDX` sample project.

This sample is created by following [this](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game) `libGDX` wiki. Only a few changes were made.

<h6>Changes different from libGDX wiki</h6>

- remove the java and HTML5 project
- extract the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` parameters, and change the unit to `dp`
- extract the parameters that can affect game difficulty, like `rainSpeed` and `rainDropInteval`
- remove sound effect because the sound assets, [water drop](http://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/30341/) and [rain sound](http://www.freesound.org/people/acclivity/sounds/28283/), could be found


<h6>Sample apk</h6>
